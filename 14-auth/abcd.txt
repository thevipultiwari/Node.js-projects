authentication and authorization

Authentication means verifying the identity of the user.
(It is the login process)

Examples:

Logging in with email + password
OTP verification
Fingerprint / Face ID
Google / GitHub login (OAuth)
API key validation

Authorization decides what resources or actions a user is allowed to access after authentication.
(It is the permission system.)

Examples:

Normal user cannot access admin dashboard
User can edit only their own profile
Only admins can delete posts
File permissions: read / write / execute

***You MUST authenticate before authorization can happen.
